BOT Information & Setup

1/ This bot is designed as a personal project not for large scale deployment to servers. This may change in the future but for now is purely hobbyist in nature. 

2/ As it's a personal project .env and venv files are ommitted, a list of the packages required to make it run can be found in a requirements.txt file 

3/ You will need your own .env file with your own discord bot setup instructions for this to run.
    Bot Setup: https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/discord.html 
    Create a .env in your main folder and add the token to it ex: DISC_TOKEN="TokenGoesHere" (bot configured to use DISC_TOKEN so change name at your own behest.)

After that should be good to go, i plan to write documentation for the bot as it becomes more developed but right now it's a bit of testing code, that runs, and i'm putting it in a repo
to 1/ have it for a portfolio down the road and 2/ to learn how to use github properly
